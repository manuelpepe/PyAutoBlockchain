Welcome to PAB's documentation!
===============================

PAB is a framework that helps with development and automation of periodic tasks on blockchains.

PAB allows you to quickly implement Strategies without worring about some implementation details, like connecting to a blockchain, retrieving contracts and sending transactions.
It also comes with a simple scheduler so you can setup jobs and forget about them (don't forget about them).
